Performing a regression analysis on the coffee ratings dataset, which includes data for both Arabica and Robusta beans across many countries and professionally rated on a 0-100 scale, could provide insights into the various factors that contribute to coffee flavor and quality. This could include variables such as the type of coffee bean, country of origin, and specific flavor characteristics such as acidity, sweetness, fragrance, and balance. Understanding the relationships between these variables and coffee ratings could be useful in the coffee industry for product development, marketing, and consumer research. Additionally, the skills developed in this data science project, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection, could be applied in other industries as well. Through this research, one can gain a greater appreciation for the nuances of coffee and how factors such as origin and flavor characteristics contribute to the overall quality and taste of a cup of coffee.
